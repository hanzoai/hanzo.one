# Copied after the install it configures, it has no effect at all — the tree is
# already laid out — and the build then dies resolving @hanzogui/* .

# 98-route BrowserRouter with its own `path="*"` NotFound, so an unknown path must
# reach index.html for the router to resolve it. Without it every deep link 404s.
